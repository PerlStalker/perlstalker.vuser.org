I've been putting off dealing with a problem at work for a while and I
finally worked out a way to deal with it. At work, when a faculty or
staff member leaves, we don't delete the account right away. Instead,
the account is disabled. It's sort of a CYA policy. It came in useful
today, in fact, when I was told that the professor whose account I
disabled a couple of days ago was actually granted emeritus status and
so his account needed to hang around a while more. The problem is that
all those disabled accounts start to add up and I didn't have an easy
way to tell which accounts can actually be whacked and which to hang
on to. Well, thanks to the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378937(WS.10).aspx">Active Directory module for Powershell</a>, I
came up with an easy way to find those accounts.
</p>

<p>
The AD module provides a cmdlet called <code>Search-ADAccount</code> which can be used to,
surprise, surprise, search for AD accounts. <code>Search-ADAccount</code> has a few
pre-built options for common searches including finding disabled accounts and
inactive accounts, i.e. accounts that haven't been used in a while.
Unfortunately, you can use both at the same time.
</p>

<p>
So, the plan is to search for disabled AD accounts and check the last logon
date. The idea is that, since the account has been disabled, the last logon
date should give a reasonable approximation of when the account was disabled.
With a little help (okay, a lot of help) from <a href="http://twitter.com/StevenMurawski">@StevenMurawski</a>, I came with
this little gem.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Search-ADAccount -accountdisabled | where {$_.lastlogondate -lt
(get-date).addmonths(-12)} | FT Name,LastLogonDate
</pre>

<p>
That prints out a list if users and the last time the user logged in who did
not log in the last twelve months.
</p>

<p>
The fun comes when you replace <code>FT Name,LastLogonDate</code> with
<code>Remove-ADUser</code>. I shouldn't have to warn you about using care with that
last command. It should happily delete all of the old, disabled
accounts. See the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617247.aspx">Search-ADAccount docs</a> for more details on limiting
the scope of your search.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2012-03-18 Sun 21:40]</span></span>:</b> You can add <code>-searchbase</code> to
<code>Search-ADAccount</code> to limit your search to a specific OU. See the
previously mentioned docs for details.
