While trying to get System Center Configuration Manager to install a package
on a new server, I rediscovered why I hate working in Windows and why I like
PowerShell. I wanted to check the end of a series of log files to see what was
going on. Unfortunately, Windows has no obvious analog to the unix tail
command. Fortunately, my friend <a href="http://jon.netdork.net/">Jon Angliss</a> had <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/j_angliss/status/9775766279553024">most of a solution</a>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Get-Content &lt;filename&gt; -wait
</pre>

<p>
That's close to what I want but not quite. What that does is almost the same
as <code>tail -f &lt;filename&gt;</code> except it prints the entire file first. What I wanted
was to print the last ten lines of the file. It turns out, there's a way to do
it but it's a little weird.
</p>

<pre class="example">
(Get-Content &lt;filename&gt;)[-10..-1]
</pre>

<p>
<code>Get-Content</code> can return an array by wrapping it in parentheses and you can work
with is using perl-ish array slices. Sticking <code>[-10..-1]</code> on the end says that
you want lines -10 to -1, i.e. the last ten lines. <b>Note:</b> Don't use zero as the
last index or it will slap the <i>first</i> line of the file at the end of the
output.
</p>

<p>
So, there it is. A convoluted way of doing something that should be
easy. See <code>Get-Help Get-Content</code> for the documentations and <code>Get-Help
Get-Content -examples</code> for examples.
