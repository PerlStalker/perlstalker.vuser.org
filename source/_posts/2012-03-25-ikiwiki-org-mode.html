I love emacs. I practically live in emacs at work. One of my favorite
features is <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>. At its simplest, org-mode is simply a markup
language similar to wiki-text or markdown. When you get into it more,
the real power of scheduling and task management comes out. In my
case, it's the only system that's I've been able to use to stay
organized. I've been so happy with org-mode that I start to looking
into using for this blog.
</p>

<p>
I looked at several options from using org-mode's publish feature to
publish HTML that I could paste into Drupal or using the native
publish feature on its own. In the end <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/">IkiWiki</a> won out.
</p>

<p>
IkiWiki has several useful features for me; mainly, the RSS/Atom feeds
and a tag cloud. Most important, the formatting language is pluggable
and there's a plugin to use org-mode instead of the native
markdown. Getting it setup was pretty straight forward but had a
couple of hang-ups because of my personal setup and there are a couple
of things to look out for when actually using it.

<p>
The first step (after installing IkiWiki) was to get Chris Gray's
excellent <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/ikiwiki-org-plugin">new_org</a> plugin. This is what does the translation of the org
files to HTML. Actually, it doesn't do the translation. Instead if
feeds the file to emacs to spit out the HTML. That's were my first
problem hit.
</p>

<p>
As I said, I already use emacs and one of the things I did on my
server was start emacs in server mode. Once in server mode, I use
emacsclient as my editor which really fast. The problem is that
new_org also uses emacs server to keep from starting emacs for every
change which speed up the translations. Unfortunately, the two servers
conflicted. I think there was an issue with the two trying to use the
same unix socket or something. I eventually switched emacs to use tcp
sockets by putting <code>(setq server-use-tcp t)</code> in <code>$HOME/.emacs</code>.
</p>

<p>
There are also a few changes in <code>new_org.pm</code> needed to support tcp
sockets. First <code>emacsclient -s org-ikiwiki-compiler</code> needs to be changed to
<code>emacsclient &#x2013;server-file=org-ikiwiki-compiler</code>. Second <code>emacs &#x2013;daemon</code> needs to be
changed to <code>emacs &#x2013;daemon=org-ikiwiki-compiler</code>. There are a couple
of places where those changes needed to be made. Once those were in
place, I was <i>almost</i> able to publish files.
</p>

<p>
I ran into a problem with emacs hanging when I tried to publish with
<code>ikiwiki &#x2013;refresh</code>. It turns out that I was still using the ancient
version of org-mode that came with emacs on Ubuntu Lucid. My problems
went away after upgrading org-mode to the latest version.
</p>

<p>
Those items done, I was able to publish new posts all day long.

<p>
The first thing to keep in mind is that the index, sidebar and tag
files all need to remain in markdown with <code>.mdwn</code> extensions. When I
tried to change them to org-mode, IkiWiki would not process them
correctly. That's a little annoying but no big deal, really, since I
hardly ever need to touch them. I mostly org-mode for the blog posts.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
This is where things got a little weird. IkiWiki directives use the
same syntax as org-mode does for links. For the most part, the two
play well together. For example, the <code>tag</code> directive does, in fact, add
tags to the post. I did run into an issue with images, however. It's
possible to use the basic org-mode link syntax to add an image but it
doesn't properly deal with paths. IkiWiki's <code>img</code> directive takes care
of that but emacs would see the HTML that the directive wrote and
happily escape the HTML.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to wrap the <code>img</code> directive in <code>#+BEGIN_HTML</code> and
<code>#+END_HTML</code> blocks and everything is happy.
</p>

<p>
I haven't used any of the other directives yet so I can't tell you
how well they work. Though that may be why the index and tag pages
where giving me grief.

With those little snags out of the way, everything is full steam
ahead. I'll keep y'all informed of anything else I run into but it's
been smooth sailing so far.
