<p>
We started our deployment of System Center Configuration Manager 2012
last week and I ran into an interesting problem.
</p>

<p>
One of the first apps I rolled out to test with was
<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>. I grabbed the 64-bit MSI and ran through the <b>Create
Application</b> wizard and added the MSI to the deployment types. One
quick deployment later and ConfigMgr was happily installing perl on my
servers. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026; Most of my servers.
</p>

<p>
You see, I still have a couple of 32-bit servers hanging around and
the 64-bit MSI wouldn't install. D'oh. So, I figured it would be easy
to jump into the <b>Requirements</b> of the distribution and limit the
package to 64-bit systems. It wasn't. While there are options for RAM
amounts, CPU speed and disk space there's nothing to test for CPU
architecture.
</p>

<p>
To fix this, I created a new <b>Global Condition</b> to test for the
"bitness" of a server.
</p>

<p>
The information I'm looking for is in the <code>AddressWidth</code> property of
the <code>Win32_Processor</code> class. You can see the list of properties by
running <code>gwmi Win32_Processor</code> in powershell. If you run
</p>

<pre class="example">
gwmi -query "select * from Win32_Processor where AddressWidth = 32"
</pre>

<p>
and get back a screen full of text, your system is 32 bit. If you
specify the wrong value for <code>AddressWidth</code>, the command will exit with
no output.
</p>

<p>
The condition properties should look something like this when you're done.
</p>

<p>
Once that's done, it was a simple matter of adding the check to the
deployment.
</p>

{% img http://perlstalker.vuser.org/images/configmgr-bitness-requirement.png 400 "Create Requirement" %}

<p>
Set the <b>Value</b> field to <code>64</code> for 64-bit systems and <code>32</code> for 32-bit
systems and you're done.
</p>

<p>
Having said all that, I'm still not sure that I haven't missed a
setting somewhere. One would think that a test to see if an app
matches the target architecture would have been a no-brainer to
include. If there's a setting I missed, please let me know because
not having it just doesn't make any sense.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2012-05-01 Tue 08:25]</span></span>:</b> One of my co-workers pointed out that
 there is, in fact, an "easier" way.
</p>

<p>
When you add a requirement, there's an option for <code>Operating
system</code>. In the tree view at the bottom of the pane, you can select
just the 64-bit version of the OS that you're targeting.
</p>

<p>
I totally missed that before. It takes a bit more clicky-clicky to use
for every 64-bit or 32-bit only package you deploy but it may be more
obvious to the next admin.
