<p>
I currently use SpamAssassin on the mail cluster at work and it works pretty
well. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well enough according to many of our
customers and, more importantly, my boss. So, I worked out this way to use
dspam and SpamAssassin.
</p>

<p>
"Why use both?" you might ask. The answer is "I don't, really." What I do is
provide dspam as an opt-in service and leave SpamAssassin as the default
filter for those that don't want to be bothered with the reporting that dspam
requires.
</p>

<p>
Some users don't want to be troubled with reporting spam or false positives or
they really dislike the <code>!DSPAM</code> tag that's added to messages filtered with
dspam but they still want some measure of spam filtering. This setup provides
that.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>databases/mysql41-server</code> You only need this if you want to use MySQL as
the storage driver and have the server on the same box.
</li>
<li><code>databases/mysql41-client</code> You only need this if you want to use MySQL as
the storage driver.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You might have noticed that mail/dspam is not on that list. That is because,
at this point, the port is not general enough for what I want to do. I suppose
I could change that, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.

<p>
When I build apps by hand instead of via the ports, I like to put them in a
seperate directory under <code>/usr/local</code>. Feel free to leave out <code>&#x2013;bindir</code> and
<code>&#x2013;sbindir</code> to have dspam install itself under <code>/usr/local/{bin,sbin}</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--with-dspam-group=courier
</pre>

<p>
Maildrop runs as group courier. I needed to set this to let the courier group
run dspam.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--with-storage-driver=mysql_drv
--with-mysql-includes=/usr/local/include/mysql
--with-mysql-libraries=/usr/local/lib/mysql
</pre>

<p>
I'm using MySQL to store account information for dspam. <b>Note:</b> The
FreeBSD port puts the MySQL headers and libraries in
<code>/usr/local/include/mysql</code> and <code>/usr/local/lib/mysql</code>,
respectively. You may need to adjust them for your setup.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-delivery-to-stdout
--enable-spam-delivery
</pre>

<p>
dspam, by default, can do it's own delivery and will quarantine spam when it
finds it. I already quarantine spam with SpamAssassin in each user's Spam
folder, and I want to treat dspam detected spam the same way. So, in order to
allow maildrop to do the quarantine, we need to tell dspam to deliver all
mail, spam or ham, to standard out.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--with-userdir=/var/mail/virtual/dspam
</pre>

<p>
This is the directory where dspam will store much of its working information.
This can be where ever you want. I put it on the NFS share for the mail dirs
that I share to the nodes in my mail cluster.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-large-scale
</pre>

<p>
This changes how dspam organizes the files in the userdir defined above.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-alternative-bayesian
</pre>

<p>
I enabled the alternative baysian to help determine what messages are spam. It
is very important to read the docs before choosing which statistical methods
to use. Choosing the wrong one (or wrong combination) can really screw over
your spam detection if you're not careful.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-homedir-dotfiles
</pre>

<p>
I want to allow users to opt-in or opt-out by creating file in their home
directory. At least, that's the idea. This didn't work for me with maildrop
and virtual users. I'm still trying to figure out why. If you know, let me
know and I'll update this page.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-opt-in
</pre>

<p>
I require my users to opt-in to dspam because of the delay in catching spam
due to training the filter and because there is no explicit whitelist. Do not
include this if you want dspam on by default.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-virtual-users
</pre>

<p>
Turn this on if you are using virtual users.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-whitelist
</pre>

<p>
My biggest (and its not that big really) complaint about dspam is that it
doesn't have whitelists. This allows for automatic whitelisting of address
under certain conditions.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-source-address-tracking
</pre>

<p>
I turned this on because, at some point, I want to some analysis of spam
addresses. Feel free to leave this off.
</p>

<pre class="example">
--enable-debug
--enable-verbose-debug
</pre>

<p>
These are useful when for debugging when you are first setting up dspam. You
should not use them in when you deploy in a production environment.

When you are testing the global maildrop filter, you may want to build with

the whole system works without messing with your users.

The dspam package comes with SQL files that you can use to setup MySQL
in <code>tools.mysql_drv/</code>. You should take this opportunity to read the
<code>README</code> file in that directory.
</p>

<p>
dspam now ships with two mysql_ojects files optimized for spam and speed. I
use the speed optimized file but modify it to use INNODB tables instead of
MyISAM tables.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</div>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The last command is only required if you are using virtual users.
</p>

<p>
If dspam is going to use a different username than to access the dspam_*
tables, you will need to create the user and give it access to those tables
with the grant command.

maildroprc.

if (/^X-Spam-Status: Yes/:h || /^X-DSPAM-Result: Spam/:h)
{
         # See if the Spam folder exists.
         `test -d "./Maildir/.Spam/"`
         if ($RETURNCODE != 0)
         {
                 # If not, copy one from the pre-existing skel directory.
                 `cp -Rp /usr/local/etc/courier/skel/Maildir/.Spam ./Maildir/`
         }
         to "./Maildir/.Spam/."
}
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> For some reason my system is having problems with nots. Hence,
the jacked-up if-else in that file. I would expect a simple <code>if (!
/^X-DSPAM-Result:/:h)</code> to work, but it doesn't.
</p>

<p>
The observant reader will notice that if dspam runs (and adds it's
<code>X-DSPAM-Result</code> header), spamc doesn't run. This is intentional. I originally
had <code>if (/^X-DSPAM-Result: Innocent/:h)</code> which would run spamc if dspam didn't
think the message was spam. I found, that once dspam was trained, spamc never
found different spam.
</p>

<p>
It also caused problems with the training process for dspam. Let me explain
with an example. Suppose a new dspam user gets a message that dspam thinks is
innocent but SpamAssassin sees as spam. The message gets tagged as spam with
the X-Spam-Status: Yes header and maildrop happily moves the message to the
Spam folder. Our user is happy because the message is caught and ignores the
message (or deletes it). What our user doesn't know, is that dspam didn't
catch the message and so scores it as innocent. That will raise the
probability that similar messages are are treated as innocent, thus making
dspam less effective. (The whole reason for putting dspam in place was that is
was more effective than SpamAssassin.)
</p>

<p>
I set it up this way for another reason, too. As I stated earlier, my users
have to opt-in to dspam. This setup provides spam filtering through
SpamAssassin for those users that choose not to use dspam. It also you to
still use SpamAssassin as a default scanner if your users choose to opt-out of
an on-by-default dspam setup.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
Each dspam user will need aliases setup to report spam and false positives to.
I use <code>.courier</code> files in the user's home directory.

<p>
Users report spam by sending it to a special alias on their account created by
adding -spam to the user name portion of their address. E.g. user@domain would
send to user-spam@domain.
</p>

<pre class="example">
|/usr/local/dspam/bin/dspam --user user@domain --addspam

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
In the case of false positives, users report it by sending it to a another
alias on their account created by adding -fp to the user name portion of their
address. E.g. user@domain would send to user-fp@domain.
</p>

<pre class="example">
|/usr/local/dspam/bin/dspam --user user@domain --falsepositive
</pre>

<p>
The suffixes can, of course, be changed by changing the name of the .courier
file.
</p>

<p>
It should be possible to setup a global aliases instead of aliases in users'
home directories. Simply create <code>/usr/local/etc/courier/aliasdir/.courier-spam</code>
with the following (untested) line.
</p>

<pre class="example">
|/usr/local/dspam/bin/dspam --user $LOCAL@$HOST --addspam
</pre>

<p>
Or you can create a spam user in each domain you host with a .courier-default
that looks like the following.
</p>

<pre class="example">
|/usr/local/dspam/bin/dspam --user $EXT@$HOST --addspam
</pre>

<p>
The false positive alias would be similar.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Don't forget to run <code>makealiases</code> if you update the global alias file.

The nicest way I found to test this setup was to build dspam with
<code>&#x2013;enable-opt-in</code> and then opt-in my test accounts. This way you can test your
production setup without screwing up mail delivery for the rest of your users.
When you're satisfied that everything is working properly, you can then
rebuild dspam without <code>&#x2013;enable-opt-in</code> and you're good to go.

<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> dspam Maintenance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
dspam comes with a couple of tools to keep your database clean: <code>dspam_clean</code>
and <code>tools.mysql_drv/purge.sql</code>. These tools are dscribed in the dspam
documentation and should be set to run periodically as described in those
docs.
</p>

<p>
I modified <code>purge.sql</code> to elimitate some locking issues I was having and, in the
process, made it 3 times faster. Basically, I combined the three deletes on
<code>dspam_token_data</code> into one.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sql">set @a=to_days(current_date());

lock table dspam_token_data write;
delete from dspam_token_data
   where
    ((innocent_hits*2) + spam_hits &lt; 5 and @a-to_days(last_hit) &gt; 15)
    or (innocent_hits = 1 and @a-to_days(last_hit) &gt; 7)
    or (@a-to_days(last_hit) &gt; 20)
   ;
unlock table;

lock table dspam_signature_data write;
delete from dspam_signature_data
   where @a-to_days(created_on) &gt; 14;
unlock tables;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Well, the locking issues went away (because I was locking the tables) but I
had more problems. The delete was taking so long to run that the system kept
maxing out the maximum number of connections. To fix this, I wrote a perl
script that deletes tokens and signatures 100 at a time and sleeps for a
couple of seconds between deletes. That gives enough time for other things to
happen between deletes. (You can see the SQL from above on lines 21-26 and
30-32.)

One thing you might have noticed is that I have removed the locks. Part of the
reason is that I moved to INNODB tables which do row-level locking so it's not
as much of a problem. Another part is that I changed the deletes to be low
priority so that they don't interfere with the normal mail flow. (See lines 21
and 30.) Finally, if the script fails to acquire a lock, it simply tries
again. (I occasionally see a failed lock or two on the dspam_signature_data
table but I haven't figured out how to make those go away. As I said, it's not
a problem but it doesn't feel "clean.")

If you want to spend the time, you can add an order by last_hit clause to the
SQL commands so that the oldest tokens and signatures are deleted first. I
didn't feel the need to spend CPU and memory on it though.
