I've been playing with this Chrome OS notebook today since it's seeming
surprisingly stable give the problems I had with it last night. I'm beginning
to wonder if the battery charge indicator was lying to me. Anyway, besides
Chrome, the app I most use on my laptop is ssh. I use it to get into my server
at home and to log into work if there are problems that I can fix from home.
It's a tool that I can't really live without. Fortunately, I don't have to.

<p>
First, I started playing with <a href="http://code.google.com/p/shellinabox/">Shell In A Box</a>. It's a daemon that runs on a
server which provides an AJAX-based terminal emulator. I can access the daemon
over SSL and get a shell inside a Chrome tab. You can also configure it to ssh
into a remote box which would let me get into my machine at work.
</p>

<p>
I was impressed by Shell In A Box's terminal emulation. It was even able to
deal with the <a href="http://perlstalker.vuser.org/blog/2010/09/30/fun-with-mutt-irssi-and-screen/">screen+mutt+irssi</a> combo I run at work.
</p>

<p>
Shell in a Box was a reasonable workaround but it wasn't quite what I was
looking for. I really wanted to be able to ssh into anything. Fortunately,
there is a solution. Hitting <code>ctrl+alt+t</code> brings up a terminal window with the
crosh shell. Crosh is extremely limited but it does have an ssh command which
does exactly what I want.
