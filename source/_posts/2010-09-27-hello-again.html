<p>
Welcome to my new, improved and slightly zombie-like SysAdmin site. This site
had been a general place to drop my docs on various things I do as a systems
administrator. At first, I thought I would put this up at my main blog, 
<a href="http://perlstalker.blogspot.com/">PerlStalker's Ramblings</a>, but that site went all politics all the time. So, I'm
moving the old posts out of tikiwiki and blogger and putting them here.
</p>

<p>
Most of the docs here, so far, are from my days at <a href="http://www.amigo.net/">amigo.net</a> with a few things
from a virtualization trade study at <a href="http://www.adams.edu/">Adams State College</a> a couple of years
ago. More stuff will be coming but at a much slower rate than Ramblings. The
posts will be mostly notes and may even be organized.
</p>

<p>
The site itself is still evolving. I have comments turned off until I decide
what I want to do with them. It's the same with the search engine. We'll see
where it goes.
