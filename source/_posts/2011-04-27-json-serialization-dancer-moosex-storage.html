<p>
I'm hacking on a new tool in perl to manage my KVM cluster. Part of it is a
RESTful interface using JSON. The objects I'm using are written using Moose
and MooseX::Storable to simplify serialization. I can convert objects back and
forth between perl objects and JSON all day. Unfortunately, there's a fly in
the ointment.
</p>

<p>
I'm using Dancer to provide the framework for the RESTful interface. The nice
thing about Dancer is that it can automatically serialize perl data structures
and it can do it via JSON. That's all shiny except Dancer's serializer doesn't
know about MooseX::Storable. In fact, Dancer chokes when I try to send an
object back from one of the handlers.
</p>

<p>
All is not lost. There is a work around that appears to work in my tests.
First of all, I needed to tell Dancer that it's okay to try and convert my
objects. This is done in <code>config.yml</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
engines:
  JSON:
    convert_blessed: '1'
</pre>

<p>
That tells Dancer, via the JSON package, to try to convert objects using the
method TO_JSON. But, wait! I don't have one of those. Yet. Fortunately,
MooseX::Storable has everything I need.
</p>

<p>
The MooseX::Storable API offers a couple of options. The first is to use
freeze() to turn the object into a JSON string. That works if I'm only
returning a single object but I'm often returning lists of things which
complicates things.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-perl"><span style="color: #00ffff;">sub</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">TO_JSON</span> { $<span style="color: #eedd82;">_</span>[0]-&gt;freeze }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Actually, it seems to work but Dancer has goes through the returned JSON
string and encodes before sending it on. That's actually a second round of
encoding since MooseX::Storable did it once already. Here's what a list
containing an object looks like.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[
   "{\"__CLASS__\":\"YAVMM::Host-0.01\",\"cluster\":\"dev\",\"name\":\
"rbsmith-desktop\",\"ram\":3924056,\"num_cpus\":4}"
]
</pre>

<p>
Ugly, huh? In fact, that might screw up anything non-perl that tries to use
the RESTful interface. We can get around that by going down one level and
using <code>pack()</code> instead.
</p>

<p>
<code>pack()</code> and the corresponding <code>unpack()</code> are required by anything implementing
the MooseX::Storage API. Rather than going all the way to JSON, <code>pack()</code> spits
back a serialized perl hashref. It turns out that that is exactly what Dancer
needs to properly encode the object. So, I changed <code>TO_JSON</code> to look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-perl"><span style="color: #00ffff;">sub</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">TO_JSON</span> { $<span style="color: #eedd82;">_</span>[0]-&gt;pack }
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The new output is below. Isn't it pretty? That's exactly what the JSON should
look like.
</p>

<pre class="example">
[
   {
      "__CLASS__" : "YAVMM::Host-0.01",
      "cluster" : "dev",
      "name" : "rbsmith-desktop",
      "ram" : 3924056,
      "num_cpus" : 4
   }
]
</pre>

<p>
On the client side, I still need to decode that mess. That's actually very
easy using the JSON module and feeding the JSON text into <code>decode_json()</code>. That
spits back a perl hash or list reference that has the (mostly) deserialized
data. I say mostly because my objects are still hashes and not objects. All
that I need to do is feed those hashrefs to <code>unpack()</code> and I get my object back.
</p>

<p>
Here's how I would translate that list above. <b>Note:</b> My object is called
YAVMM::Host. You would, of course, use your own class name instead. Also,
assume that <code>$json_text</code> has the JSON text. How it got there is beyond the scope
of this document.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-perl"><span style="color: #98fb98;">my</span> @<span style="color: #eedd82; text-decoration: underline;">hosts</span> = map { YAVMM::Host-&gt;unpack($<span style="color: #eedd82;">_</span>) } @{ decode_json($<span style="color: #eedd82;">json_text</span>) };
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now <code>@hosts</code> is a list with a bunch of YAVMM::Host objects that I can have all
sorts of fun with.
</p>
