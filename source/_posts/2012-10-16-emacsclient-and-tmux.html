<p>
Hello. My name is PerlStalker and I'm an emacs user. I love emacs and
use it for nearly everything but there are a few things it's not good
at. ("Like editing," I hear all you warped vi users cry.) Among them,
and most important to me, are window management and terminals.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with terminals. I use eshell from time to time to do quick
and dirty things on the command line but I always run into weird
things that don't work like I expect. For example, there's a little
one liner I run to convert the mp4 videos of my podcast that I get
from YouTube to mp3. Eshell chokes on it. The more powerful and better
featured term-mode and it's more friendly cousin multi-term-mode are
pretty good but I still run into tools, from time to time, that break
it. (To be fair, it seems to be better in emacs 24 but I haven't
played with it as much.)
</p>

<p>
My main use of terminals, however, is logging into Linux servers and
making changes. I can do weird things with eshell and tramp to edit
files but it's kinda slow. If I try to edit a file on the server
through an editor in term-mode, all sorts of things break.
</p>

<p>
The other thing that emacs is bad at is window management. A little
terminology before I go further, emacs uses the term "frames" for what
X11 and Microsoft call windows. The term windows is used by emacs when
it splits a frame to display multiple buffers. Emacs can split frames
horizontally and vertically all day and not have a problem. Where
things get hairy is if you use something like gnus which feels like it
can do whatever it wants to your window layout at anytime. It's a real
pain in the neck when I have multiple buffers opened, looking at
different things, then hit <code>M-x gnus</code> to check my email and <b>boom</b> all
of my buffers have been hidden in favor of whatever gnus wants to
do. Not cool, emacs. Not cool.
</p>

<p>
However, something that is good at handling window layouts and shells
is tmux. Tmux is similar to screen in that it provides an "always-on"
session that you can access from multiple places. Where it beats
screen is in its scriptability and window management. Those two
features make it especially nice for what I'm going to show you. On a
side note, you can apply most of this to screen with a little work
but it was really easy to do in tmux.
</p>

<p>
The super secret ingredient to all of this is emacs server and
emacsclient. Emacs server allows you to connect to a running instance
of emacs to do things (like edit files or run elisp functions) without
starting a whole new emacs instance. That makes it really fast. You
can start emacs server by running <code>M-x server-start</code> or have it happen
automatically when emacs starts by putting <code>(server-start)</code> in
<code>$HOME/.emacs</code>. You can even use <code>emacs &#x2013;daemon</code> to start emacs in
the background when you log in or with the <code>@reboot</code> tag in cron to
start it when the machine starts. The <code>&#x2013;daemon</code> option has the
fringe benefit of leaving emacs running even if you log out.
</p>

<p>
Now to how this all works with tmux. First, I need to redefine
"window". (Don't you just love overloading definitions?) Basically,
tmux only lets you see one window at a time. You can switch between
them but you can never see more than one. However, you can split them
into "panes" and this is where tmux shines. I'm not going to get into
here but you can see <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux&sektion=1">the man page</a> to see how easy it is to create,
resize and navigate between panes.
</p>

<p>
The first problem I needed to solve was to quickly and easily ssh
into servers. Based on <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmux&sektion=1">the examples in the docs</a>, I added these lines
to my <code>$HOME/.tmux.conf</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key S   command-prompt -p "host" "split-window 'ssh %1'"
bind-key C-s command-prompt -p "host" "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
</pre>

<p>
If I hit the prefix (<code>C-b</code> by default, <code>C-z</code> in my case) followed by
<code>C-s</code>, tmux prompts me for a host name (which can also be <code>user@host</code>)
and then opens a new window for the ssh session. If I do <code>C-z S</code>
instead, it opens the ssh session in a new pane in the same
window. Using a pane rather than a new window is useful when I'm
checking things on multiple servers at the same time. The window or
pane closes when the ssh session is finished.
</p>

<p>
Now for the fun. Here's where emacsclient comes in. Let's say that I
want to open emacs inside tmux. By adding this magic to <code>.tmux.conf</code>
and reloading the config I can open emacs in a new window (<code>C-z y</code>) or
new pane (<code>C-z C-y</code>).
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key y   new-window -n "emacs"  "emacsclient -nw"
bind-key C-y split-window "emacsclient -nw"
</pre>

<p>
Emacs opens extremely quickly because it's already running. Even
better, because it's emacsclient, you can switch to any buffer that
you already have open in other clients, even if you opened it in the
X11 version of emacsclient.
</p>

<p>
That's great but there are other things I want to do in emacs besides
edit files. For example, suppose I want to jump into gnus to check my
email.
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key g   new-window -n "gnus" "emacsclient -nw --eval '(gnus)'"
bind-key C-g split-window "emacsclient -nw --eval '(gnus)'"
</pre>

<p>
<code>C-z g</code> opens gnus in a new tmux window and <code>C-z C-g</code> opens gnus in a
new pane.
</p>

<p>
I'm using a personal convention that whatever key I bind, by itself,
opens in a new window and control plus that key opens in a new pane.
</p>

<p>
If you can script it in elisp, you can make it a shortcut in
tmux. I have shortcuts to open w3m &#x2026;
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key W   new-window -n "w3m" "emacsclient -nw --eval '(w3m)'"
bind-key C-w split-window "emacsclient -nw --eval '(w3m)'"
</pre>

<p>
&#x2026; and I have one to open the RT command line with emacsclient set as
the editor in a multi-term buffer. (The editor magic is hidden in a
separate script (<code>~/bin/rtc</code>) to get around some restrictions with the
RT command line and the <code>EDITOR</code> environment variable.)
</p>

<pre class="example">
(defun rtc ()
  (interactive)
  (if (get-buffer "*rtc*")
      (switch-to-buffer "*rtc*")
    (rtc-create)
    )
)

(defun rtc-create ()
  (eshell t)
  (rename-buffer "*rtc*")
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (eshell-kill-input)
  (insert "~/bin/rtc")
  (eshell-send-input)
)
</pre>

<p>
Then in <code>.tmux.conf</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key C-r split-window "emacsclient -nw --eval '(rtc)'"
</pre>

<p>
Now I can open my ticket list and edit tickets in a pane while I
actually work on the ticket in another pane.
</p>

<p>
You could use this as an example for opening any shell app within
emacs. Obviously, if you just want to bring up the app outside of
emacs, you can do something magical like this &#x2026;
</p>

<pre class="example">
bind-key C-m command-prompt -p "man" "split-window 'exec man %%'"
</pre>

<p>
&#x2026; which prompts you for a man page when you hit <code>C-z C-m</code> then opens
it in a new pane. It's super convenient if you want to check the docs
for a tool you're using. (I could have used emacs man- or woman-mode
instead of calling man directly but this was simple and easy.)
</p>

<p>
If, for some strange reason, you would rather use vi to edit a file,
you could simply replace <code>man</code> in the previous command with <code>vi</code> and
change the key binding.
</p>

<p>
For even more special sauce, you could use <a href="https://launchpad.net/byobu">byobu</a> with tmux to
display any number of fun widgets at the bottom of the window. I use a
custom script combined with gcalcli to display the next thing I have
coming up on my calendar.
</p>

<p>
The combination of tmux (+byobu) and emacsclient gives me a very
efficient and very powerful way to get things done at work. If you're
an emacs user, I highly recommend looking into emacsclient even if
you don't need tmux or screen but combining the two makes for much
joy and happiness.
