Following up on a previous post discussing finding old user accounts in Active
Directory, here's how you find old computer accounts.
</p>

<p>
This works on basically the same premise as the user script. In short, we're
going to check the last time the computer logged into Active Directory. That
happens on every reboot and from time to time while the machine is up. The
same warning applies to computers as it does for user accounts. The last logon
timestamp is only accurate to about a week. Since people are generally
checking back six months or more, it isn't much of an issue.
</p>

<p>
To get the list of stale machines:
</p>

<pre class="example">
get-adcomputer -properties lastLogonDate -filter * | where { $_.lastLogonDate
-lt (get-date).addmonths(-12) } | FT Name,LastLogonDate
</pre>

<p>
You can throw a sort in there if you'd like.
</p>

<pre class="example">
get-adcomputer -properties lastLogonDate -filter * | where { $_.lastLogonDate
-lt (get-date).addmonths(-12) } | sort Name | FT Name,LastLogonDate
</pre>

<p>
It's just as easy to delete all of those accounts. I've added a <code>-whatif</code> to
make it harder to do something stupid with cut-and-paste. Take it off to
actually delete the computer accounts.
</p>

<pre class="example">
get-adcomputer -properties lastLogonDate -filter * | where { $_.lastLogonDate
-lt (get-date).addmonths(-12) } | Remove-ADComputer -whatif
</pre>

<p>
<b>Updated 2011-06-20 14:15:</b> Added a missing <code>}</code> to every example. Don't you hate
it when you have a bug in your code and you copy and paste that same line over
and over again? Me, too.
