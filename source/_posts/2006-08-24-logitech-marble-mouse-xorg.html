I recently got a Logitech Marble Mouse at work. It's a nice little trackball
but it has a minor problem. There is no button 2. "What is button 2?" you
might ask. Button 2 is the middle mouse button. On your average scroll mouse,
this is the button that is triggered when you click the scroll wheel. "So?"
you might then ask. So, the middle mouse button is used in X to paste stuff
from the X clip board. It's a handy little feature and one that I don't want
to give up. So, here's what I did to make this trackball usable for me. Keep
in mind, I use my trackball left-handed so all you poor righties will just
have to adjust.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The Plan</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The Marble Mouse comes with four buttons. There are two large ones and two
smaller ones. The smaller one will, by default, act as a scroll wheel. That's
a nice feature but there are even better ways of handling this in X.org.
(These docs will probably work with XFree86, too, but I haven't tested them.)
I wanted to use the small button on the right as my middle button. (Remember,
I'm flying lefty.) The small button on the left, is going to trigger the
scroll features.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> .xmodmap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
<code>.xmodmap</code> is used to by X.org to change your local keymappings. It can also
change the mappings for your mouse buttons using the pointer command. Here's
what mine looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
pointer = 3 5 1 4 2 6 7
</pre>

<p>
Let's go through this together, shall we? First, you'll notice that the
numbers are out of order. The positions of the numbers correspond to the
default button positions. If you don't set pointer, the default would be the
same as saying
</p>

<pre class="example">
pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
</pre>

<p>
The buttons on the Marble Mouse are numbered this way by default:
</p>

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col class="left"/>

<col class="right"/>

<col class="right"/>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="right">Left</td>
<td class="right">Right</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">Big</td>
<td class="right">1</td>
<td class="right">3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="left">Small</td>
<td class="right">4</td>
<td class="right">5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The first thing I did was swap buttons 1 and 3. This reverses the main
buttons. This is your standard swap for lefties. Next, I swapped button 5 for
my non-existant button 2. This gives me the middle-click that I want.
Everything else was left the same. You can enable your changes by running
<code>xmodmap ~/.xmodmap</code>. I recommend adding that command to your <code>.xsession</code>
file so that it's run when you log into X.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> X.org Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now, I didn't really want to lose the scroll features, so I made some changes
to <code>xorg.conf</code> so that I can get those back and, in fact, get a few more
features. Before you start screwing with your X config, you want to do is
create a backup of <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> so that you have a working config to
go back to. Go ahead and do that. I'll wait. &#x2026; Okay, now that you've
finished your backup, we can proceed. Here are the relevent sections of my
<code>xorg.conf</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Section "ServerLayout"
...
InputDevice    "MarbleMouse" "CorePointer"
...
EndSection
...
Section "InputDevice"
Identifier  "MarbleMouse"
Driver      "mouse"
        Option "CorePointer"
        Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
        Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
        Option "Buttons" "7"
        Option "EmulateWheel" "1"
        Option "EmulateWheelButton" "4"
        Option "XAxisMapping" "6 7"
        Option "YAxisMapping" "4 2"
EndSection
</pre>

<p>
In the <code>ServerLayout</code> section for your system, you need to add the Marble Mouse
to your config to verify that it gets used. Then create a new <code>InputDevice</code>
section for the MM. Many of these options are described in this post to the
Ubuntu forums at <a href="http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-77005.html">http://www.ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-77005.html</a>.
The <code>EmulateWheel</code> switch tells X that we want to enable the wheel features when
a button is pressed. <code>EmulateWheelButton</code> tells X that we want to use button 4
(the small, left button) for that. The important changes are to the 
<code>YAxisMapping</code> line. Normally, that is set to "4 5" but since we swapped those
in <code>.xmodmap</code> we need to swap the buttons, we need to set that to "4 2".
Restart X for those changes to take effect.
</p>

<p>
Now, when you log back into X, you can hold down the small, left button and
move the ball, your pages will scroll up and down and to the sides.
