Like many people, I setup courier to use mysql for
authentication. When I went through the setup, I decided to store
username as user@domain in the accounts table. Users who are not in
the default domain, can login as user@domain and they are good to
go. This works well in most modern email clients, but some older
clients, notably Netscape 4.5, can't use this syntax and are unable to
login.
</p>

<p>
The standard workaround is to allow users to login with
''user%domain''.  That's all well and good, but courier, by default,
doesn't know how to work with the %. There are a couple of ways to fix
this, both require using <code>MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE</code> in <code>authmysqlrc</code>.

<b>Note:</b> It seems that some time between courier-mta 0.45.x and 0.47, the order
of things changed. Here's the list from the two versions:
</p>

<p>
<b>0.45.x</b>
</p>

<pre class="example">
username, cryptpw, uid, gid, clearpw, home, maildir, quota, fullname
</pre>

<p>
<b>0.47</b>
</p>

<pre class="example">
username, cryptpw, clearpw, uid, gid, home, maildir, quota, fullname, options
</pre>

<p>
The selects below have been updated for the 0.47 requirements.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Option 1: Change Your Schema</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The first option is to change your DB schema so that you split out the
user name and domain into two fields. This is the easiest solution if
you have no data already. If you put the user name and domain into
fields named user and domain, you can use something like the code
below. <b>Note:</b> This is untested.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sql">MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE SELECT concat(user, <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'@'</span>, domain), <span style="color: #ffa07a;">''</span>, clearpw        \
                         uid, gid, home, <span style="color: #ffa07a;">''</span>, quota, name, options        \
                         FROM EmailAccounts                              \
                         WHERE (user = <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)'</span>                   \
                         and domain = <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(domain)'</span>)                       \
                         OR (username = SUBSTRING_INDEX(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)'</span>, \
                         <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'%'</span>, 1)                                         \
                         AND domain = SUBSTRING_INDEX(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)'</span>,   \
                         <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'%'</span>, -1))
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Option 2: Just Change the Select</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It's not always possible to change your schema or doing so causes
other problems. Not a problem. You can use the code below. <b>Note:</b> This
is what I use on my servers.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sql">MYSQL_SELECT_CLAUSE     SELECT username, <span style="color: #ffa07a;">''</span>, clearpw,                        \
                         uid, gid, home, <span style="color: #ffa07a;">''</span>, quota, name, options            \
                         FROM EmailAccounts                                  \
                         WHERE username = <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)@$(domain)'</span>          \
                         OR username = CONCAT(SUBSTRING_INDEX(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)'</span>,\
                            <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'%'</span>, 1),                                         \
                            <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'@'</span>, SUBSTRING_INDEX(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">'$(local_part)'</span>, <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'%'</span>, -1))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Option 1 is probably faster, but I haven't benchmarked it personally.
