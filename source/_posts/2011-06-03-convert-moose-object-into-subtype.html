<p>
Have you ever had the situation where you had a parent class but you find out
later in the code that you really want a subclass? With perl Moose, it's
really easy to do.
</p>

<p>
Consider the classic point example described in 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~doy/Moose-2.0001/lib/Moose/Cookbook/Basics/Recipe1.pod">Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe1</a>. Suppose I start with a Point but I decide
later that I need that point to shift into 3D. I don't want to change the
values for x and y, I just want to add the new z point. I could brute force it
by creating a new point and copying the values over from the old point but
that feels like more work than it should be. Well, it is.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Moose uses Class::MOP::Class which provides the rebless_instance
method which can convert a object into a subtype.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-perl"><span style="color: #00ffff;">package</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">Point</span>;
<span style="color: #00ffff;">use</span> <span style="color: #7fffd4;">Moose</span>;

has <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'x'</span> =&gt; (isa =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'Int'</span>, is =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'rw'</span>);
has <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'y'</span> =&gt; (isa =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'Int'</span>, is =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'rw'</span>);

<span style="color: #00ffff;">package</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">Point3D</span>;
<span style="color: #00ffff;">use</span> <span style="color: #7fffd4;">Moose</span>;
extends <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'Point'</span>;

has <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'z'</span> =&gt; (isa =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'Int'</span>, is =&gt; <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'rw'</span>);

<span style="color: #00ffff;">package</span> <span style="color: #87cefa;">main</span>;
<span style="color: #00ffff;">use</span> <span style="color: #7fffd4;">Data</span>::Dumper;

<span style="color: #98fb98;">my</span> $<span style="color: #eedd82;">p1</span>  = Point-&gt;new(x =&gt; 4, y =&gt; 3);
print Dumper $<span style="color: #eedd82;">p1</span>;

$<span style="color: #eedd82;">p1</span> = Point3D-&gt;meta-&gt;rebless_instance($<span style="color: #eedd82;">p1</span>);
print Dumper $<span style="color: #eedd82;">p1</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And the output:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'y' =&gt; 3,
                 'x' =&gt; 4
               }, 'Point' );
$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'y' =&gt; 3,
                 'x' =&gt; 4
               }, 'Point3D' );
</pre>

<p>
Now <code>$p1</code> is a Point3D object rather than a Point object.
</p>

<p>
You can go backwards, too, with the <code>rebless_instance_back</code> method but you face
the potential for data loss when you do that.
