I've been a busy PerlStalker this week. As you may have noticed, this
site has changed somewhat. I've recently decided to drop Drupal and
switch to IkiWiki. Drupal has been good to me but it's really too
heavy for my little blog. I have no use for most of the features that
Drupal provides and it's not worth it to me to keep it up-to-date.
</p>

<p>
IkiWiki has a couple of really nice things going for it. First, it
spits out static pages. Except for search and comments, there's no need for
any dynamic content on my site. Google and Disqus fill both needs. I
could use the IkiWiki CGI but there's really no need.
</p>

<p>
Second, I can compose my posts in emacs org-mode. It beats the heck
out of writing all of my posts in straight HTML. I had to jump through
a few hoops to use org-mode but it's working great now. I'll post more
on that later.
</p>

<p>
By default, IkiWiki uses a pretty nice syntax called markdown. I chose
not to use it because org-mode is, in many ways, simpler and more
powerful than markdown and I use it for all of my note taking and
documentation at work.
</p>

<p>
Now, a little housekeeping. One of the drawbacks to moving to IkiWiki
was that I was unable to get it to use the original posting dates from
Drupal. All of the imported posts have a line at the top that has the
original posting date.
</p>

<p>
Along those lines, you've probably already seen the slew of reposts in
your feed reader. That's a symptom of the conversion to IkiWiki. This
should be the only time it'll be a problem.

Thanks for reading.
