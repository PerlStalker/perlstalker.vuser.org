So, here's the situation. I have a stack of VM servers running KVM and
libvirt. The hosts need to connect to a SAN for ISO storage and,
potentially, VM disks. The problem is that the VM running DNS may not
be up yet when the host starts. That's a problem since I'm referencing
the san by it's host name rather than the IP address. Yes, I could
change all of my configs to use the IP instead but host names are a
lot easier to deal with, most of the time.
</p>

<p>
Well, I could work around the lack of DNS by putting an entry for the
server in <code>/etc/hosts</code> but then I'd have to update it on every server
if I ever change the IP address. Fortunately, puppet makes it
easy. Sort of.
</p>

<p>
Puppet is a wonderful tool for managing Linux (and other *nix)
servers. It's a little weak, though, when all you want to do is add a
line to file. That's exactly what I wanted to do with <code>/etc/hosts</code>.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that puppet has a hook into the tool <a href="http://www.augeas.net/">augeus</a>. That
makes editing the config relatively easy but plugging that into puppet
is still a little messy. To make it easier, I created a class and
define to tidy that up a bit.

<b>Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2012-09-03 Mon 07:15]</span></span>:</b> Puppet actually makes this easier
 than I thought. There already exists a <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#host">host data type</a> that I totally
 missed before. Dominic Cleal also <a href="https://twitter.com/domcleal/status/242533984200978432">pointed me to</a> a module that he
 wrote that adds <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/domcleal/augeasproviders">augeus providers</a> to some of the default data types,
 including host.
</p>


<pre class="example">
class hosts {
  define entry(
    $ipaddr,
    $canonical,
    $aliases = 'UNSET' # I want to make this an array
    )
    {
      augeas { "create_$title":
        context =&gt; '/files/etc/hosts',
        changes =&gt; [
                    "ins 01 after 1",
                    "set 01/ipaddr $ipaddr",
                    "set 01/canonical $canonical"
                    ],
        onlyif  =&gt; "match *[ipaddr = '$ipaddr'] size == 0"
      }

      augeas { "update_$title":
        context =&gt; '/files/etc/hosts',
        changes =&gt; [
                    "set *[ipaddr = '$ipaddr']/canonical $canonical"
                    ],
      }

      Augeas["create_$title"] -&gt; Augeas["update_$title"]

      # It would be great if I could loop this
      if ($aliases == 'UNSET') {
        augeas { "alias_$title":
          context =&gt; '/files/etc/hosts',
          changes =&gt; [
                      "rm *[ipaddr = '$ipaddr']/alias[1]"
                      ],
        }
      }
      else {
        augeas { "alias_$title":
          context =&gt; '/files/etc/hosts',
          changes =&gt; [
                      "set *[ipaddr = '$ipaddr']/alias[1] '$alias'"
                      ],
        }
      }
      Augeas["update_$title"] -&gt; Augeas["alias_$title"]
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
There are a couple of known issues. First, you can't unset an
entry. If you add a host with this and then decide that you no longer
want it there, you can't take it out. I don't think it would hard to
add that feature but I haven't.
</p>

<p>
Second, the define only lets you set the first alias. Augeas allows
for multiple aliases and I could pass an array to the define but I
don't know how to loop through that list.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here's how you use the define within a node or class
definition.
</p>

<pre class="example">
include hosts
hosts::entry { 'san':
  ipaddr    =&gt; '192.168.1.5',
  canonical =&gt; 'san.example',
  aliases   =&gt; 'san'
}
</pre>

<p>
You can use as many <code>hosts::entry</code> blocks as you want.
