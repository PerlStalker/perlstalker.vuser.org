<p>
Setting up the 2100S is actually pretty simple. Here's how I did it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Configure your Kernel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The 2100S uses the asr driver which is included in the GENERIC kernel,
however, I take that out of my custom kernels since most of my machine do not
have a RAID controller at all, so I added this line to my kernel config and
rebuilt.
</p>

<pre class="example">
device          asr             # DPT SmartRAID V, VI and Adaptec SCSI RAID
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Install the Adaptec RAID Control Software</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The CD that comes with the controller includes some software to control and
configure the RAID. What bugs me is that, be default, it want's to install
itself into <code>/usr/dpt</code> and I'm not really thrilled with installing third-party
software in <code>/usr</code>. That's OK though, it's easy enough to install it in <code>/usr/</code>
local by using the -p option to pkg_add.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">mount /cdrom
pkg_add -p /usr/local/dpt /cdrom/package/FreeBSD/apps/sm/adptfbsd_314.tgz
umount /cdrom
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Configure the RAID</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Now is the time to stop and make sure that you have your HDDs installed and
ready. The drives need to be pristine, i.e. they cannot have any existing
partitions, etc. and cannot have the same SCSI ID as the controller. (The
2100S uses ID 7 by default.)
</p>

<p>
It's probably a good idea to disable kern.securelevel before proceeding as
well, as it may prevent the controller from accessing the drives properly.
</p>

<p>
Now that everything is ready, it's time to create the array. Let's pretend
that we have eight HDDs with IDs 1-6, 8 and 9 (remember, the controller is
using ID 7), and we want to build a RAID-10 array.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> I used raidutil to do the setup because I don't have X installed on that
server. Feel free to use Storage Manager or Storage Manager Pro.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Identify the Controller Address</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
We need the Adaptec address for the controller we're using for the RAID. In my
case, the ID is d0. The ID will be used to tell raidutil which controller
we're creating the RAID on.
</p>

<pre class="example">
bash-2.05b# ./raidutil -L controller
#  b0 b1 b2  Controller     Cache  FW    NVRAM     Serial     Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Get the Adaptec Addresses for the HDDs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
<code>raidutil</code> requires that you refer to your HDDs by their Adaptec addresses. You
can get the the HDD addresses with the physical parameter to -L. Note: -c d0
is what tells raidutil which controller to look at. Remember, d0 is the ID we
got above.

<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Build the RAID-10</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Now it's time to build the RAID. The setup below creates the stripe across
mirrored pairs. The + between addresses denotes the mirroring. You can mirror
the drives in any order. What seemed a little weird to me was setting the RAID
level (-l) to 1 but it works.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The raidutil man page that came on my CD seems to have an error when
discussing RAID-10 configutation. From the man page:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
To create a RAID 10 configuration specify groups in pairs as follows:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">raidutil -c c1 -l 1 -g c1t1d0,c1t2d0,c1t3d0,c1t4d0
</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice that there are no + signs anywhere in that command to denote drive
pairs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> -g must be the last option to the command. If it is not, your other
options will not be applied.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">./raidutil -c d0 -l 1 -z 64 -g d0b0t1d0+d0b0t2d0,d0b0t3d0+d0b0t4d0,d0b0t5d0+d0b0t6d0,d0b0t8d0+d0b0t9d0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can use -L raid to watch the controller build the RAID. When it's done,
you should see something like this.

<p>
You're Done
</p>

<p>
Congratulations! You now have a working RAID. The RAID should be available as
/dev/da0. You can now label and partition the RAID as you would for any other
drive.

I recently came in to the tune of the RAID controller's alarm going off. The
server just kept chugging way without a hitch. I'm beginning to like RAID.

It looks like I lost two drives. That's not good at all. However, this is
still survivable. Replace the drives then run:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./raidutil -c d0 -a rebuild d0b0t1d0
</pre>

<p>
Now when you run raidutil -L raid you should be something like this:

root@accounts dpt# ./raidutil -c d0 -L raid
