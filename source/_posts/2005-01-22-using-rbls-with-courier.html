<p>
Real-time Blacklists (RBLs) are commonly used to block mail from known
spammers or servers that can be used to send spam (open relays and the
like).
</p>

<p>
I found a lot of good info on setting up rbldnsd here.
</p>

<p>
I use Bind 9 on my DNS servers so that I can run rbldnsd on the same
IP as bind. Note: Setting up and configuring Bind 9 for basic DNS is
beyond the scope of this document.
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, you do not need to setup rbldnsd (or Bind fot that
matter) since courier can do the lookups directly from the RBL
privider. If you handle a lot of mail, however, you will want to use a
local copy of the RBL to speed up query responses and to keep from
DoSing the RBL provider's servers.

You can use RBLs in a couple of ways in courier. The first is to block them outright by setting the BLOCK environment variable, the other is to set an environment variable (e.g. BLOCK2) that maildrop (or another MDA) can use to make choices with. See couriertcpd(8) for (many) more details.
</p>

<pre class="example">
BLACKLISTS="-block=list.dsbl.org,BLOCK -block=sbl.spamhaus.org,BLOCK"
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Courier will not use other blacklists that set the same
 environment variable if the first one hits. Put your largest (and
 most likely to hit) blacklist first to save some processing time when
 the server is blacklisted.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-2-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">2.1.2</span> maildroprc</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
If you are using an environment variable like BLOCK2, you can use a
global mail drop filter like this to quarantine messages that hit the
RBL. <b>Note:</b> This is untested.
</p>

<pre class="example">
import BLOCK2 

if ($BLOCK2)
{
         `test -d "./Maildir/.Spam/"`
         if ($RETURNCODE != 0)
         {
                 # If not, copy one from the pre-existing skel directory.
                 `cp -Rp /usr/local/etc/courier/skel/Maildir/.Spam ./Maildir/`
         }
         to "./Maildir/.Spam/."
}
</pre>

<p>
Instead of moving the message to a Spam folder, you could use an
xfilter to add a header to the message that the use could then filter
on. Here you can take advantage of the fact that courier can set your
variable to the value of the TXT record, A record or admin defined
message for the blacklisted address.
</p>

<pre class="example">
import BLOCK2

if ($BLOCK2)
{
xfilter "reformail -a'X-Blacklisted: $BLOCK2'"
}
</pre>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> rbldnsd</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
rbldnsd does not use any configuration files beyond the zone
files. Everything else is read from the command line. You can add the
flags to /etc/make.conf or to /usr/local/etc/rc.d/rbldnsd.sh. I prefer
the former.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2-1" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<pre class="example">
rbldnsd_enable="YES"
rbldnsd_flags="-r /usr/local/etc/rbldnsd -f -b 127.0.0.1/1053"
rbldnsd_flags="$rbldnsd_flags list.dsbl.org:ip4set:list.dsbl.org"
rbldnsd_flags="$rbldnsd_flags cbl.abuseat.org:ip4set:cbl.abuseat.org"
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> I am running rbldnsd on port 1053 on the localhost address
 127.0.0.1. Feel free to adjust those values for your own setup. You
 can listen on multiple addresses by secifying -b address/port again.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Bind 9</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
I'm using Bind 9. You can use Bind 8 as well, but Bind 8 doesn't let
you specify a port in the forwarders block. If you choose to use Bind
8, you will have to run rbldnsd on a separate IP address.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.1</span> named.conf</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
We're going to tell bind to forward all requests for an RBL that we
mirror to rbldnsd. To do this, we simply need to add a zone entry to
named.conf of type forward.
</p>

<pre class="example">
# RBLs
# rbldnsd should be running on the dns server on port 1053.

zone "list.dsbl.org" IN {
         type forward;
         forward first;
         forwarders {
                127.0.0.1 port 1053;
         };
};
</pre>

<p>
In the example above, I have a forward zone for list.dsbl.org which is
mirrored by rbldnsd. Add a similar block for every RBL you are
mirroring.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Bind 8 users will, of course, not be able to specify a port here.

<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Keeping Your Blacklists in Sync</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
Now that you're all setup, you need to get the rbldns zone files and
keep them synced. Most of the RBL providers allow rsync access to
their zone files which makes things very nice. Below is an example on
how to get the list.dsbl.org zone.
</p>

<pre class="example">
rsync -t rsync.dsbl.org::'dsbl/rbldns-list.dsbl.org' /usr/local/etc/rbldnsd/
</pre>

<p>
Generally, you will want to write a quick script that will go out and
get all of your zones that you can run from cron. There are a plethora
of scripts out there but the simplest is to create something that
looks like this.
</p>

<pre class="example">
#!/bin/sh
rsync -t rsync.dsbl.org::'dsbl/rbldns-list.dsbl.org' /usr/local/etc/rbldnsd/
rsync -t rsync://rsync.cbl.abuseat.org/cbl/list.txt /usr/local/etc/rblsdns/
</pre>

<p>
As is my wont, I have written a little Perl script to sync the zone
files called rsync-zones. There is a sample config file available as
well.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2012-03-15 Thu 17:01]</span></span>:</b> I no longer have the sciprt mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
Then add the something like the following to /etc/crontab.
</p>

<pre class="example">
36      *       *       *       *       root    /usr/local/sbin/rsync-zones
</pre>
</div>
</div>
