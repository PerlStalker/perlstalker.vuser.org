I use <a href="http://gpodder.org/">gPodder</a> to pull podcasts for all my listening pleasure at
work. I had been using gnome-mplayer to listen to them but after a
recent re-install, gnome-mplayer started to hanging every when I pause
the playback. Gmplayer works fine so I know that mplayer, by itself,
is not the problem but that doesn't have a systray icon to make it easy
to click and pause playback.
</p>

<p>
Since I'm so frequently using emacs, I thought to myself "I wonder if
I can do this in emacs?" Of course, I can. Enter <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emms/">emms</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> emms Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

Based on a little bit of research, I decided to use mplayer as the
backend. The setup is pretty easy. This is what I'm using based on
<a href="http://dryice.name/blog/emacs/emms-using-mplayer/">this blog post</a>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp"><span style="color: #ff7f24;">;; </span><span style="color: #ff7f24;">emms</span>

(<span style="color: #00ffff;">require</span> '<span style="color: #7fffd4;">emms-player-mplayer</span>)
(<span style="color: #00ffff;">require</span> '<span style="color: #7fffd4;">emms-source-file</span>)
(<span style="color: #00ffff;">require</span> '<span style="color: #7fffd4;">emms-source-playlist</span>)

(setq emms-player-mplayer-command-name <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"mplayer"</span>
      emms-player-mplayer-parameters '(<span style="color: #ffa07a;">"-slave"</span>)
      emms-player-mpg321-command-name <span style="color: #ffa07a;">"mpg123"</span>
      emms-player-list
      '(emms-player-mplayer
        emms-player-mplayer-playlist
        emms-player-mpg321
        emms-player-ogg123))
</pre>

Now that I can listen to the music via emacs, I need to tell gPodder
how to feed the podcasts into emms. It's simple to add them to
playlist from outside of emacs with this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">emacsclient --server-file=work --eval <span style="color: #ffa07a;">'(emms-add-file "TD140.mp3")'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In <code>$HOME/.config/gpodder/gpodder.conf</code>, you can set the <code>player</code>
setting. gPodder replaces the <code>%U</code> with the file name. &#x2026; In
theory. In practice, gPodder only replaces <code>%U</code> if it's at the end of
the line. That means I needed to write a quick wrapper.
</p>

<p>
{% include_code lang:perl add2emms.pl %}
</p>

<p>
I run emacs in daemon mode (with TCP). If you don't, you'll want to
change the <code>$emacs</code> variable.
</p>

<p>
And you're done. Happy listening.
